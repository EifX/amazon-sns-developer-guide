# Origination identities for SMS messages<a name="channels-sms-originating-identities"></a>

When you send SMS messages using Amazon SNS, you can identify yourself to your recipients using the following types of *originating identities*:
+ [Sender IDs](channels-sms-originating-identities-sender-ids.md)
+ [Origination numbers](channels-sms-originating-identities-origination-numbers.md)

**Note**  
Amazon SNS SMS messaging is available in Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is not currently supported\. If you operate in Europe \(Stockholm\), Middle East \(Bahrain\), Europe \(Paris\), South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\), or US West \(N\. California\), open the Amazon Pinpoint console in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region to register your 10DLC company and campaign, but *do not* request a 10DLC number\. Instead, use the [AWS Service Quotas console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?region=us-east-1&skipRegion=true#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase) to create a service limit increase case while requesting the 10DLC number for that Region\. To learn more about how to request origination identities, see [Requesting support for SMS messaging with Amazon SNS](channels-sms-awssupport.md)\.
