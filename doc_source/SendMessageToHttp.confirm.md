# Step 3: Confirm the subscription<a name="SendMessageToHttp.confirm"></a>

After you subscribe your endpoint, Amazon SNS will send a subscription confirmation message to the endpoint\. You should already have code that performs the actions described in [Step 1](SendMessageToHttp.prepare.md) deployed to your endpoint\. Specifically, the code at the endpoint must retrieve the `SubscribeURL` value from the subscription confirmation message and either visit the location specified by `SubscribeURL` itself or make it available to you so that you can manually visit the `SubscribeURL`, for example, using a web browser\. Amazon SNS will not send messages to the endpoint until the subscription has been confirmed\. When you visit the `SubscribeURL`, the response will contain an XML document containing an element `SubscriptionArn` that specifies the ARN for the subscription\. You can also use the Amazon SNS console to verify that the subscription is confirmed: The **Subscription ID** will display the ARN for the subscription instead of the `PendingConfirmation` value that you saw when you first added the subscription\.
