# Message Data Protection security<a name="sns-message-data-protection"></a>
+ [Message Data Protection](message-data-protection.md) is a feature in Amazon SNS used to define your own rules and policies to audit and control the content for data in motion, as opposed to data at rest\.
+ Message Data Protection provides governance, compliance, and auditing services for enterprise applications that are message\-centric, so data ingress and egress can be controlled by the Amazon SNS topic owner, and content flows can be tracked and logged\.
+ You can write payload\-based governance rules to stop unauthorized payload content from entering your message streams\.
+ You can grant different content\-access permissions to individual subscribers, and audit the entire content\-flow process\.
