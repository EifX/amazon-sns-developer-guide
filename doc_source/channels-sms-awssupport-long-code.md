# Requesting 10DLC numbers, toll\-free numbers, and P2P long codes for SMS messaging with Amazon SNS<a name="channels-sms-awssupport-long-code"></a>

**Important**  
Effective June 1, 2021, US telecom providers no longer support using person\-to\-person \(P2P\) long codes for application\-to\-person \(A2P\) communications to US destinations\. Instead, you need to use another type of origination ID for these messages\. For more information, see [Special requirements for sending SMS messages to US destinations](channels-sms-us-requirements.md)\.

To request [10DLC numbers](channels-sms-originating-identities-10dlc.md), [toll\-free numbers](channels-sms-originating-identities-tfn.md), and [P2P long codes](channels-sms-originating-identities-long-codes.md), use the Amazon Pinpoint console\. For detailed instructions, see [Requesting a number](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/settings-request-number.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint User Guide*\.

Amazon SNS SMS messaging is available in Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is not currently supported\. In these cases, open the Amazon Pinpoint console in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region to register your 10DLC company and campaign, but *do not* request a 10DLC number\. Instead, open a case in the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) to request a 10DLC number in the AWS Region where you use or plan to use Amazon SNS to send SMS messages\. For information on Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is available, see [Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/pinpoint.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

**Note**  
If you're new to SMS messaging with Amazon SNS, you should also request a monthly SMS spending threshold that meets the expected demands of your SMS use case\. By default, your monthly spending threshold is $1\.00 \(USD\)\. For more information, see [Requesting increases to your monthly SMS spending quota for Amazon SNS](channels-sms-awssupport-spend-threshold.md)\.
