# What is Amazon SNS?<a name="welcome"></a>

Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers \(also known as *producers* and *consumers*\)\. Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a *topic*, which is a logical access point and communication channel\. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported protocol, such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages \(SMS\)\.
