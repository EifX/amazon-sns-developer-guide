# Special requirements for sending SMS messages to US destinations<a name="channels-sms-us-requirements"></a>

**Important**  
US mobile carriers have recently changed their regulations, and will require that all toll\-free numbers \(TFNs\) complete a registration process with a regulatory body before September 30, 2022\. If you currently have a toll\-free number you must register your toll\-free number by September 30, 2022 or you will no longer be able to use the toll\-free number\. You can check the status of your number by going to [Toll\-free number registration status](channels-sns-sms-tfn-register.md#tfn-registration-status)\. For more information about registering your company see [Registering your toll\-free number](channels-sns-sms-tfn-register.md#registering-tfn)\.  
It can take up to 15 business days for your registration to be processed after it is submitted\.

Effective June 1, 2021, US telecom providers no longer support using person\-to\-person \(P2P\) long codes for application\-to\-person \(A2P\) communications to US destinations\. Instead, you need to use one of the following types of [origination numbers](channels-sms-originating-identities-origination-numbers.md) for messaging US destinations:
+ [Short codes](channels-sms-originating-identities-short-codes.md)
+ [10\-digit long codes \(10DLC\)](channels-sms-originating-identities-10dlc.md)
+ [Toll\-free numbers](channels-sms-originating-identities-tfn.md)
