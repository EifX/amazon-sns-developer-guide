# Step 4: Set the delivery retry policy for the subscription \(optional\)<a name="SendMessageToHttp.retry"></a>

By default, if the initial delivery of the message fails, Amazon SNS attempts up to three retries with a delay between failed attempts set at 20 seconds\. As discussed in [Step 1](SendMessageToHttp.prepare.md), your endpoint should have code that can handle retried messages\. By setting the delivery policy on a topic or subscription, you can control the frequency and interval that Amazon SNS will retry failed messages\. You can set a delivery policy on a topic or on a particular subscription\.
