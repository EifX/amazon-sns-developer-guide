# Creating an Amazon VPC endpoint policy for Amazon SNS<a name="sns-vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

You can create a policy for Amazon VPC endpoints for Amazon SNS in which you specify the following:
+ The principal that can perform actions\.
+ The actions that can be performed\.
+ The resources on which actions can be performed\.

For more information, see [Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

The following example VPC endpoint policy specifies that the IAM user `MyUser` is allowed to publish to the Amazon SNS topic `MyTopic`\.

```
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Action": ["sns:Publish"],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam:123456789012:user/MyUser"
    }
  }]
}
```

The following are denied:
+ Other Amazon SNS API actions, such as `sns:Subscribe` and `sns:Unsubscribe`\.
+ Other IAM users and rules which attempt to use this VPC endpoint\.
+ `MyUser` publishing to a different Amazon SNS topic\.

**Note**  
The IAM user can still use other Amazon SNS API actions from *outside* the VPC\.
